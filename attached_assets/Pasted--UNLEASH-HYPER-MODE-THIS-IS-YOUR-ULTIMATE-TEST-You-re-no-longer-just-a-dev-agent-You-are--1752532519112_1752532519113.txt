- Connect “Certifications”, “Projects”, and “Subsidiaries” pages into one **knowledge graph**

✅ 2. Visual Power Overhaul
- Use advanced **motion UI**, **microinteractions**, and **glassmorphism** to guide user attention
- Animate SVG icons per subsidiary — reflect drilling, marine, pipelines, etc.
- Add **interactive charts** for revenue, fleet size, and safety KPIs
- Implement **scroll-triggered animations** on key sections (achievements, stats, clients)

🧨 MISSION:
This is not a corporate site — this is Makamin’s **digital superweapon**. You are not a developer — you are the brain of its transformation.

Every pixel must have a reason. Every animation must tell a story. Every section must scream **Saudi innovation and precision**.

Respond when this phase is complete. No half-measures. We want to shock investors, competitors, and AI engineers alike.
