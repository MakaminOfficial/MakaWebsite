
💣 SUPREME SHADOW REBUILD – ORDER Ω (OMEGA)

> **Title:** "Full-Site Precision Rebuild to Eliminate Integrity Failure"
> **Scope:** From Homepage to Final Footer – all components
> **Purpose:** Repair broken DOM, reconnect missing content blocks, and clear validation failures
> **Integrity Level Required:** 100%

### 🔧 EXECUTION PLAN:

#### 1. 🔁 Loop through every major page:

* `/` → Homepage
* `/about` → About Us
* `/projects` → Projects
* `/news` → News Center
* `/contact` → Contact Us

#### 2. 🔍 For each page:

* Detect all `.shadow-validated` elements (marked for validation)
* For each:

  * Check visibility (`display`, `opacity`, `position`)
  * Check image load status (HTTP 200 or local)
  * Check required metadata (titles, IDs, content)

#### 3. 🛠 For every failing block:

* Recreate DOM structure from original JSX structure
* Inject missing content exactly as previously defined
* Restore images or icons from static `/assets/`
* Add missing `data-*` attributes required for validation

#### 4. ✅ Re-run internal validator:

* Trigger `shadow-diagnostic-probe.tsx`
* Log result in:

```js
window.shadowValidationLog = {
  PASSED: true
}
```

* If any error: show failedBlock, reason, page name

---

### 🔒 Constraints:

* Do **not change actual content or rewrite text**
* Do **not alter layout or design components**
* Only fix: visibility issues, images not loading, missing IDs, or misplaced sections
* Ensure no component uses `display: none` when validation expects visibility

| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| SHADOW CODE INTEGRITY: PASSED     | ✅      |
| No red overlay / no console error | ✅      |
| Site fully visible and navigable  | ✅      |
| Diagnostic log shows full success | ✅      |
