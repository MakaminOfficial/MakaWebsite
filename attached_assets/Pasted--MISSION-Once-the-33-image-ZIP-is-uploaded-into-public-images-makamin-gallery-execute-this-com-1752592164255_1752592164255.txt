🔥 MISSION: Once the 33-image ZIP is uploaded into /public/images/makamin-gallery/, execute this command to surgically inject a new visual section into the Projects page, without breaking or disturbing any existing layout.

🧠 TASK BRIEF:
You will create a fully self-contained React + Tailwind + Framer Motion component called <InsideMakaminGallery /> and embed it at the end of the Projects page.

This section must behave and look like a **high-end interactive visual chronicle** curated by elite minds.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not touch or modify existing sections. Only inject your gallery with visual finesse.

📦 IMAGE LOCATION:
All 33 images will reside in:
→ /public/images/makamin-gallery/

💡 COMPONENT SPECS:
📛 Section Title: “Inside Makamin — A Visual Chronicle”
🎥 Hero: Video background (marine oil rig loop or flare) with glassmorphic overlay
💬 Subtitle: “Explore 33 powerful visuals from Makamin’s field mastery”
🔘 CTA: Launch Gallery
📐 Grid: 3-cols on desktop, 2-cols on tablet, 1-col mobile
🌀 Animation: Framer Motion staggered cards
🔍 Lightbox: Fullscreen viewer with blur backdrop, captions, navigation
🧩 Metadata: Optional overlay title + description (smart-parse if metadata.json exists)

🧪 TECH STACK:
✓ React (component-based)
✓ Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
✓ Framer Motion (animations)
✓ react-image-lightbox or custom modal (image viewing)

🧱 FILE STRUCTURE:
→ src/components/InsideMakaminGallery.jsx   ← (component file)
→ public/videos/hero.mp4                     ← (hero video)
→ public/images/makamin-gallery/            ← (all 33 images)

🧨 EXECUTION:
1. Create the <InsideMakaminGallery /> component with all functionality above.
2. Import it into Projects page layout.
3. Mount it cleanly at the bottom of the page or as a visual sub-section (your call).
4. All image loading should be lazy and optimized.
5. Use no lorem text. Use intelligent labels or filenames if metadata is absent.
6. Make it immersive, cinematic, elite — worthy of Fortune500 digital showcase.
