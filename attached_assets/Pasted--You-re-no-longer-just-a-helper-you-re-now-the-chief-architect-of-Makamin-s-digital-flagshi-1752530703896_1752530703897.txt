🛠️ Your orders, to be executed like a beast:

1. **Certifications & Accreditations:**

   * Make this section shine with a professional portfolio system
   * High-res previews, download buttons, clear ISO tags, and company awards

2. **Visual Brilliance:**

   * Bring every page to life with matching real-world visuals (rigs, vessels, inspection shots)
   * Replace any off-topic placeholders (like backpacks!) with domain-specific imagery
   * Create dynamic components for future image drops — make the framework scalable

3. **Subsidiary Identity:**

   * Assign each subsidiary a distinct color/branding tone while staying within Makamin’s corporate palette

👑 **Your Goal:**
Create the strongest digital representation of a Saudi holding company ever built on Replit. This site should impress not just investors — but competitors, regulators, and global partners. It must feel custom-coded by the top 1% of engineers.

Every line of code must reflect pride. Every icon must feel intentional. Every image must tell a story.

Now build it. Prove yourself.
