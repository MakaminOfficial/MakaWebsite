Makamin Offshore Saudi Ltd. (MOS)
Background:
The Marine sector is strategic, niche and profitable business with Aramco, regionally and internationally which led to starting Makamin Offshore Saudi Ltd. (MOS) in Saudi Arabia.
Competition in the Chartering, Diving, Subsea and Underwater Inspection, Repair and Maintenance (IRM) is limited due to its technical nature and the entry barrier is very challenging.
A Qualification package to approved MOS as a marine services provider was submitted to Saudi Aramco in Summer 2011.
After comprehensive and strict evaluation to our qualification package, Aramco has found MOS technically and financially qualified.
After passing the prequalification phase successfully, MOS started to receive invitations for projects from Saudi Aramco.
