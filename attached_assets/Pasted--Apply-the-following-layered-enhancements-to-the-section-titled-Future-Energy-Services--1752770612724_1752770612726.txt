🔥 Apply the following layered enhancements to the section titled: “Future Energy Services”

---

🎯 1. [Visual Identity Overhaul — AI Branding]
Replace the current dull icons with bold SVG icons that visually reflect smart, AI-powered operations:

- **Advanced Drilling Services**  
  Icon: Robotic drilling rig or AI circuit integrated with drill bit

- **Smart Pipeline Systems**  
  Icon: Connected pipeline with signal waves or IOT nodes

- **Advanced Offshore Operations**  
  Icon: Smart vessel with radar or ocean waves & satellite overlay

- **Smart Investment Analytics**  
  Icon: AI brain overlay on a financial chart or predictive arrow growth icon

✅ All icons should be:
- Monoline or minimal outline SVG style
- Animated slightly on hover (pulse or glow)
- Scalable without losing resolution

---

🧠 2. [Interactive Hover FX — Responsive Intelligence]
On hover over each card:

- Icon: scale up slightly (`scale(1.08)`), add soft glow border
- Card background: transitions to light gradient (blue-to-white or gold)
- Text: title changes color (Makamin blue `#003f6a`), and underline appears on Learn More

---

🌐 3. [Dual-Language Heading]
Change current heading:

From:
`Future Energy Services`  
To:
`الخدمات المستقبلية للطاقة | Future Energy Services`

Subtext remains as:
“AI-powered services to meet the needs of the future energy industry”

---

🎨 4. [Depth & Layout]
- Add soft shadow (`shadow-xl`) to each card for better visual separation
- Optionally, apply **glassmorphism** background to each card (blurred white overlay, semi-transparent)

---

🧭 5. [Optional: Timeline Overlay Animation]
- Add a **subtle animated line** above the cards titled:  
  `Journey to the Future — 2025 to 2030`

Line animates slowly from left to right, repeating, to simulate ongoing progress and strategic future.

---

🛑 6. [Do Not]
- Do not remove any content
- Do not rename services
- Do not change text
- Do not restructure layout grid

🎯 Final Outcome:
This section must now **look like a dynamic AI product launch**, not static info blocks. Each service card should feel like a smart module in a control center. The user must feel pulled forward into the future.
